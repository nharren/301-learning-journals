# LJ Code 301 - Day 10

On Day 10, We learned about functional programming, specifically using the declarative functions map, filter, and reduce, to perform operations without modifiying the original data.

We also learned about Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE), which are used to produce a scope enabling the creation of variables and functions private to that scope. The only parts that are exposed are those which are explicitly attached from within the IFFE to an object existing in a higher scope.
