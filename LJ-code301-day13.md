# LJ Code 301 - Day 13

On day 13, I learned how REST and HTTP relate. HTTP provides the method of communication, and REST provides the style. REST stands for Representational State Transfer and focuses on using verbs to indicate actions being performed on a resource, such as "GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH", etc. Many APIs follow the REST style.
