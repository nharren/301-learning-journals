# LJ Code 301 - Day 11

On day 11, we learned about client-side routing through page.js. Client side routing allows you to serve different urls without making a request to the server. I learned that you can set a route from "/" => index.html to "*" => index.html on the server side so that if you refresh the page on a client side url, it doesn't give an error.
